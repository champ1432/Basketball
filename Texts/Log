February 3rd, 2021:
    * In lineups, created commands that depict who is playing and modified the players teams so they now correlate to the teams that are playing
    * Inputted the Jazz team into the Team DB
    * Reorganized files and created specific folders/directories for each file (App, Texts)
    * Created a log and edited TO-DO LIST
    * Created 4th team, Cavs, and inputted roster/stats/etc

February 4th, 2021:
    * Created a command in PlayerDB that finds teams by team_id
    * Edited Home and Away ratings to allude to the teams better (don't know if this messes things up, but I like it and may be useful, seems better)
    * Added Commentary to Sim and hope to be able to put it side by side (A. wait for GUI / B. see if there is a command for specific amount of spaces)

February 6th, 2021:
    * Changed Commentary function to 3 individual functions (useful for tkinter){For Tkinter to work with functions, print needs to be return}
    * Created a Tkinter file where the GUI shows the opening commentary with return statements.

    * Pieced together multiple variations, but finally found something that worked
    * Updated TO-DO List

March 5th, 2021:
    * Added a delay to how fast the sim displays in the console, Game_timer and Intro_timer
